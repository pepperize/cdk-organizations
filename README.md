# AWS Organizations

This project provides a CDK construct managing AWS organizations, organizational units and accounts.

> Currently, there is no `@aws-cdk/aws-organizations` available. See this [Issue on AWS CDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/2877).

- [AWS Organizations User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html)
- [AWS API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html)

## API Reference

See [API.md](https://github.com/pepperize/cdk-organizations/blob/main/API.md)

## Install

### TypeScript

```shell
npm install @pepperize/cdk-organizations
```

or

```shell
yarn add @pepperize/cdk-organizations
```

### Python

```shell
pip install pepperize.cdk-organizations
```

### C\# / .Net

```
dotnet add package Pepperize.CDK.Organizations
```

## Getting Started

1. Prepare an IAM User with `AdministratorAccess`

   To deploy your new organization, you have to create an Administrator with an Access Key

   - [Creating your first IAM admin user and user group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html)
   - [Managing access keys for IAM users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey)

2. Create a new CDK TypeScript App project with [projen](https://github.com/projen/projen)

   ```shell
   mkdir my-project
   cd my-project
   git init -b main
   npx projen new awscdk-app-ts
   ```

3. Add `@pepperize/cdk-organizations` to your dependencies in `.projenrc.js`

   ```typescript
   const project = new awscdk.AwsCdkTypeScriptApp({
     //...
     deps: ["@pepperize/cdk-organizations"],
   });
   ```

4. Create a stack

   ```typescript
   export class OrganizationStack extends Stack {
     constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: StackProps = {}) {
       super(scope, id, props);

       // Create or import your organization
       const organization = new Organization(stack, "Organization", {});
       // Add organizational units, accounts, policies ...
     }
   }
   ```

## Usage

### Organization

To create a new organization or import an existing organization, add the following construct to your stack:

```typescript
const organization = new Organization(stack, "Organization", {
  featureSet: FeatureSet.ALL,
});
```

- `FeatureSet.ALL` is required for advanced features like Service Control Policies and is the [preferred way to work with AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html)
- The account which deploys the stack automatically becomes the management account of the new organization.
- If an organization already exists, it will be automatically imported. The account which deploys the stacks must be the management account.
- If the construct gets removed from the stack the organization still remains and must be manually deleted.
- For deletion of an organization you must previously remove all the member accounts, OUs, and policies from the organization.
- Currently, you can have only one root. AWS Organizations automatically creates it for you when you create the new organization.
- It can only be used from within the management account in the us-east-1 region.

### Organizational Unit (OU)

To create a new organizational unit (OU), add the following construct to your stack:

```typescript
const organizationUnit = new OrganizationalUnit(stack, "Organization", {
  organizationalUnitName: "Project2",
  parent: organisation.root,
});
```

To import an existing organizational unit (OU), add the following to your stack:

```typescript
const organizationUnit = OrganizationalUnit.fromOrganizationalUnitId(stack, "Organization", {
  organizationalUnitId: "ou-1234",
  organizationalUnitName: "Project2",
  parent: organisation.root,
});
```

- The parent of an organizational unit (OU) can be either the organization's root or another OU within the organization.
- An organizational unit (OU) can't be moved. You have to create a new one and move all the accounts.
- For deletion of an organizational unit (OU) you must first move all accounts out of the OU and any child OUs, and then you can delete the child OUs.
- It can only be used from within the management account in the us-east-1 region.

### Account

To create a new account, add the following construct to your stack:

```typescript
new Account(stack, "Account", {
  accountName: "MyAccount",
  email: "info@pepperize.com",
  iamUserAccessToBilling: IamUserAccessToBilling.ALLOW,
  parent: organization.root,
});
```

To import an existing account, add the following to your stack:

```typescript
Account.fromAccountId(stack, "ImportedAccount", {
  accountId: "123456789012",
  parent: organization.root,
});
```

- The email address must not already be associated with another AWS account. You may suffix the email address, i.e. `info+account-123456789012@pepperize.com`.
- An account will be created and then moved to the parent, if the parent is an organizational unit (OU).
- It can only be used from within the management account in the us-east-1 region.
- An account can't be deleted easily, if the construct gets removed from the stack the account still remains. [Closing an AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_close.html)

## Limitations

AWS Organizations has some limitations:

- The stack can only be deployed in the `us-east-1` region.
- The stack's account must be the management account of an existing organization.
- The stack's account becomes the management account of the new organization.
- An account belongs only to one organization with a single root.

const app = new App();
const stack = new Stack(app);

// Create an organization
const organization = new Organization(stack, "Organization", {
  featureSet: FeatureSet.ALL,

// Enable AWS Service Access (requires FeatureSet: ALL)
new EnableAwsServiceAccess(stack, "EnableAwsServiceAccess", {
  servicePrincipal: "service-abbreviation.amazonaws.com",

// Create an account
const account = new Account(stack, "SharedAccount", {
  accountName: "SharedAccount",
  email: "info+shared-account@pepperize.com",

  iamUserAccessToBilling: IamUserAccessToBilling.ALLOW,
  parent: organization.root,
});
// Enable a delegated admin account
new DelegatedAdministrator(stack, "DelegatedAdministrator", {
  account: account,

});

// Create an OU in the current organizations root
const projects = new OrganizationalUnit(stack, "ProjectsOU", {
  organizationalUnitName: "Projects",
  parent: organization.root,
});
new Account(stack, "Project1Account", {
  accountName: "SharedAccount",
  email: "info+project1@pepperize.com",

// Create a nested OU and attach two accounts
const project2 = new OrganizationalUnit(stack, "Project2OU", {

  parent: project2,
});

// Enable the service control policy (SCP) type within the organization
new EnablePolicyType(stack, "EnablePolicyType", {
  root: organization.root,
  policyType: PolicyType.SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY,
});
// Create and attach and Service Control Policy (SCP)
